# Theme Update

1. Make changes to any theme(-s)
2. Update [VERSIONS_ARCHIVE.md](../VERSIONS_ARCHIVE.md) :
   - Change old versions link from `*/releases/latest/download/*` to `*/releases/{tagname}/download/*`
   - Add new version with link to `*/releases/latest/download/*`
3. Commit and Create new tag. Name sample: `build-ddmmyyyyhhmm`
4. Push tag to remote and create **release**
5. Attach <ins>ALL</ins> theme files *(Even if they don't have any changes)* to release to make `*/releases/latest/download/*` work properly
6. Well done, mate 👏. Give yourself a cookie 🍪.
